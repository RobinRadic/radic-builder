Custom JS Library builder
===================

##### Status: Development


#### Purpose:

- **Personal project**. Just playing around and learning some new stuff
- To better understand jQuery inner workings
- To build a smaller sizes jQuery library, by removing all unneeded stuff for certain projjects
- Add some features by extending jQuery
- Using LoDash build tools to integrate into jQuery
- Everything should be configurable in the _config.yml file.

Main goal is to create a process that makes it possible to only include features that are usefull for any project so the result will be as small as possible.

#### Current modules:
- cookie
- crypt
- etag
- github
- lodash (not the whole library, just a few features)
- widget factory (created by jquery-ui)
- sprintf/vsprintf
- asyncWaterfall

#### Current widgets
- Github Profile widget
