**Status: Development**
Custom JS Library builder using jQuery's modular build method.

##### What is it?
Create a library based on jQuery with custom added modules.
Both jQuery and the custom modules can be picked by altering the config.yml file.
This results in either a smaller or bigger script file.

This way it's possible to customise it for individual project requirements.

Smallest build is around 12kb (4kb minified, 1kb gzip)
